A value at risk algorithm created in java 

The commit frequency of this project has not been up to standard so acknowledging,
 this to attempt to combat this, i  have tried to explain and comment the most frequent commit to the best of my ablility.

The final version of the valueAtRisk program succcefully provides an insight into the different methods of calclation value at risk.
including testing these values against the hidtorical data.
